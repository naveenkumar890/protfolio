            <h3>peer to peer Carpooling using Blockchain</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The project "Peer-to-Peer Carpooling using Blockchain" aims to address the limitations of traditional carpooling systems, such as centralized control, security vulnerabilities, and lack of transparency, by leveraging blockchain technology. By creating a decentralized platform, the system ensures secure, transparent, and immutable transactions while automating key processes through smart contracts. This blockchain-powered carpooling model promotes cost efficiency, trust, and environmental sustainability by reducing carbon emissions and fuel consumption. It also eliminates intermediaries, enhancing user interaction and reliability. The project sets a foundation for scalable and innovative applications in transportation and beyond..</li>
